# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.


# Casting
# If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
# Example
a = str(3)    # x will be '3'
b = int(3)    # y will be 3
c = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)


# Get the Type
# You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
# Example
age = 5
name = "John"
print(type(age))
print(type(name))
